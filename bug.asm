```assembly
mov eax, [ebx+0x10]
add eax, ecx
mov [ebx+0x10], eax
```

This code snippet demonstrates a potential race condition. If another thread or interrupt modifies the memory location `[ebx+0x10]` between the `mov eax, [ebx+0x10]` instruction and the `mov [ebx+0x10], eax` instruction, the result will be incorrect. The intermediate value read into `eax` may not reflect the final value after the update.

The problem lies in the lack of synchronization mechanisms.  Without appropriate locks, mutexes, or atomic instructions, data races can occur, leading to unpredictable and unreliable program behavior.
