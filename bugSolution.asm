```assembly
; Assuming the architecture supports atomic instructions
lock add dword ptr [ebx+0x10], ecx 
```

This uses the `lock` prefix (x86 specific) to ensure that the `add` instruction is atomic. Other architectures have different ways to implement atomic operations.  The critical section is now protected, avoiding the race condition.  If atomic instructions are not available, alternative synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes (which would require a more substantial code change) must be employed.
